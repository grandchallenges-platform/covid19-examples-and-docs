    "# Challenge 3: Quantifying and Communicating Uncertainty in Dispersion Forecasts of Radioactive Material\n",
    "\n",
    "Radioactive material in large quantities can cause a hazard to human health. In larger quantities, the radiation from radioactive material can cause burns, hair loss and even death and in lower quantities, there is an increase in the risk of various cancers. In the event of an accidental release of radioactive material into the atmosphere dispersion models are used, in conjunction with available measurements, to estimate the air concentration and deposits of radioactive material.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make estimates of concentration and deposits the dispersion models require information about the quantity, timing and physical characteristics of the release as well as details of the meteorological conditions during the period of release and transport of pollutants. The accuracy of the estimates depends on the accuracy of the release details and meteorological predictions. There is an increasing pressure (from the scientific community and decision makers) to provide information on the uncertainty of the concentration and deposit estimates\n",
    "\n",
    "Uncertainty in the release information may be provided by using different models of nuclear reactor accidents or by using different inverse dispersion model simulations to match model estimates to measurements. Uncertainty in the meteorological information is typically provided by a meteorological ensemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meteorological ensembles are generated by making small perturbations to the initial conditions and the model physics and rerunning the forecast several times. These uncertainties can be combined to generate an ensemble of dispersion model predictions. These estimates then need to be processed for presentation to stakeholders and decision makers. Recently studies have been carried out to look at how uncertainty might be quantified and presented to decision makers. The Fukushima accident has been used as a case study\n",
    "\n",
    "On 11 March 2011 a large earthquake occurred in the Pacific Ocean about 70 km to the east of Japan. The quake and the subsequent tsunami damaged the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant (NPP) leading to the release of radioactive material into the atmosphere. Although much of the radioactive material was transported eastwards over the Pacific Ocean there were several days when material was transported inland over Honshu resulting in significant deposits in Fukushima and neighbouring prefectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, large releases combined with meteorological conditions that transported material inland resulted in much of the contamination to the northwest of the Fukushima Dai-ichi NPP. The provided dataset contains dispersion model estimates of the air concentration. The estimates were made by running the dispersion model using nine descriptions of the release (known as source terms) and 51 meteorological ensemble members from the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Some ideas of things that could be investigated:\n",
    "- How can the uncertainty in a dataset be quantified?\n",
    "- How can the uncertainty in a large ensemble dataset be communicated?\n",
    "-- Think about the audience you are presenting to\n",
    "-- Think about the method by which you are communicating\n",
    "-- Think about the time available for presenting the information\n",
    "- How do we compare ensemble predictions to measurement data?\n",
    "- How do we communicate the differences between the ensemble predictions and the measurement data?\n",
    "- What are the relative benefits of (a) the measurement data and (b) the model predictions?\n",
