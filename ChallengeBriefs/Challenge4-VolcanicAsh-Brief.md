# Challenge 3: Quantifying and communicating uncertainty in volcanic ash forecasts

Volcanic ash within the atmosphere can pose a significant hazard to aircraft leading, in some cases, to engine failure. During a volcanic eruption, forecasts are made of the predicted atmospheric transport and dispersion of the ash cloud and advisories issued to the aviation community.

These forecasts are made using complex volcanic ash transport and dispersion models (VATDMs) and are guided by observations from satellite imagery and expert opinion. There are uncertainties in the forecasting procedure which can lead to significant errors in the ash cloud forecast.

The three main sources of uncertainty in the forecasting process are:
- the source term representing the release of ash into the atmosphere (e.g., the mass emission rate, the height of the emissions, the particle size distribution and the variation of these emission properties over time),
- the driving input meteorological data (representing the evolving state of the atmosphere and taken from Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models),
- the volcanic ash transport and dispersion model (which employs parametrizations to represent complex atmospheric processes and the effects of small sub-grid scale motions).

This project explores the uncertainty in volcanic ash forecasts by studying an ensemble of volcanic ash forecasts, each obtained using a chosen source term, input NWP dataset and VATDM configuration. Ideas which teams could be investigate include:
- How can uncertainty in volcanic ash forecasts be quantified?
- How can uncertainty in volcanic ash forecasts be communicated to decision makers in a useful way, taking account of
-- The high-pressured situation?
-- The need to make quick decisions?
-- Differing levels of understanding?
- What impact does risk (e.g., engine maintenance vs engine failure) and other competing factors (e.g., economic) have?
- Which is best for decision making: an ensemble or a deterministic forecast? (Deterministic = a single forecast not accounting for uncertainty)
